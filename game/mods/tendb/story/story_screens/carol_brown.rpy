# Scenario
# Carol Brown enters office.
# Informs you that she her son isn't a smart student, but she wants him to enter Ashford academy because of high standards (policy for admission set to high, academy > 65)
# Two choices: Accept $1500 and small boost to artistry or say you wish to visit her home to see what kind of life she and her son lives. Second choice is sex route.

# After home visit, recieve a pic from her wanting more. Preferably receive photo with cell phone, but if not implemented, get photo on office desk.

# Return back for another home visit.

# We load images to be shown and the variations.
# Carol Brown in Blue
