horst horst
To be honest Lia, I am sure you would look great in any outfit.

Nurse Lia
I will make sure to always keep an "outift" on then. Shame, it's quite
relaxing to slip out of it now and then.

horst horst
Haha, Isn't birthday suit considered an "outfit"?

Nurse Lia
Oh principal, are you trying to get me undressed?

Hello?

Dr. Kent
Mr. horst? I'm doctor Kent from the County Hospital. Sorry to disturb
you at this hour but there has been an accident.

horst horst
An accident?

Dr. Kent
Yes, I'm sorry but the girl doesn't seem to have any relatives in town
so I was hoping that perhaps you could come here and -

horst horst
I'm sorry doctor but which girl are we talking about?

Dr. Kent
Oh, how clumsy of me. I'm terribly sorry, I should have... She had a
briefcase with documents that carried Ashford's header and an ID that
-

horst horst
Which girl doctor?!

Dr. Kent
Her name is Jennifer. The Id says: Jennifer Adriano, but it doesn't
say if she's -

horst horst
My god...

Dr. Kent
Obviously you must know her and -

horst horst
She was my secretary.

Dr. Kent
Oh, I... I'm truly sorry Mr. horst.

horst horst
I'm on my way.

horst horst
What happened?

Dr. Kent
Looks like a hit and run. I'm sorry, but the injuries were far too
severe for us to be able to save her. She was in a real mess when she
came in.

horst horst
...

Dr. Kent
I understand she was your secretary?

horst horst
Yes, she started working for me just a few days ago.

Once again, you have my condolences.

She's the editor of the school's newspaper.

Girl
Get your brand new issue of the Ashford Gazette, Principal! Breaking
news and shocking investigations by your favorite reporter!


Instead of breaking news, what this rag really focusses on is gossip,
urban legends and cheap fan fiction. The problem page is pretty
popular with heartbroken students, though.

You wave and move on. Other students realize you don’t care if they
kiss in class, and more are starting to do it.

Jan 31: Wednesday evening


In the outskirts of the school grounds, you see two girls standing
real close.


Suddenly, one leans forward and gives the other a passionate kiss.


After a short struggle, the other one gives in and lets her tongue
answer the invitation.

Night


It's getting late, so you decide to go to sleep.

Susan
Mr. horst every month we receive feedback from students, teachers and
parents organizations. We use this feedback to set up a list of goals
for our academy to strive for.

Susan
I try to order all the feedback and create a list where we choose one
goal to focus on every month. Failing to achieve the set goal will
result in negative publicity and hurt the schools reputation.

Susan
Please also keep in mind that you can influence how high we set each
and every goal.

Susan
So Mr. horst, what goal will we have for this month?

A scraping noise prompts you to peek into a classroom that should be
empty this time of day. You see a faintly blushing girl lying nearly

You meet some girls talking and giggling about boys and dates.

Jan 31: Wednesday morning


Knock Knock


You stir up from your seat, surprised by the knocking on the door.

horst horst
Come in?


The door opens and a lady in a blue yakata walks in. Her mature and
innocent appearance is matched with a figure that's heavy in all of
the right places.

Carol Brown
Hello Mr. horst. I am Carol Brown. Please let me speak with you? This
is very important.

Choice: You see a distressed women and decide to listen to her.
Choice: You wonder how Susan let someone get to your door without
notifying you first.

User chose: You wonder how Susan let someone get to your door without
notifying you first.

horst horst
I'm sorry Mrs. Brown, but I am very preoccupied right now. Please make
an appointment with Susan, my scretary, and we can meet again soon.


You go to lead her out the door, but she doesn't move.

Carol Brown
Please Mr. horst. I'm sorry for bothering you, but I must speak with
you. I can't wait any longer.


You become a bit flustered that she was on the verge of tears. She
seems very desparate and it would be a good idea to let her stay than
let her cry as she leave.

horst horst
Ok ok. It's alright. I'll listen to what you have to say.

Carol Brown
Well, I have a son and I wish to enter him into your academy.

horst horst
Well that is a simple process. All your son has to do is pass our exam
and he can enter.

Carol Brown
Well that's the thing. He has taken the test and failed, but I know my
son is a bright student. I know that if he transfers here he will do
very well in school. The teachers at his school are so horrible and
he's so sad there. I'm sorry that he has to go to the school he's
going to now and all I see is him failing. I know he's so smart and it
makes me very sad...


You can hear her voice starting to crack.

horst horst
I'm sorry for your son Mrs. Brown. Education is essential to a
fulfilling life and it's unfortunate that it's not taught correctly
everywhere.

Carol Brown
You understand then, right? How important education is? Will you
please accept my son into your academy?

horst horst
I'm afraid, however, that there are rules and your son has to go
through the examination process like everyone else. While our goal
here at Ashford Academy is to promote a complete and thorough
education, if your son can't handle it then it will be wasted.

Carol Brown
Please I beg of you. I am a single mom running a small restaurant and
my son only haves me. I try to keep my son as happy as possible, but I
don't have the time to teach him at home. I know what I'm about to say
is a bit forward, but I'm willing to make a small donation to your
school and I can send someone to help teach cooking if my son is
accepted...

Choice: While you might be doing better academically recently, a
little bit of help can go a long way...
Choice: Maybe you should visit her home...

User chose: While you might be doing better academically recently, a
little bit of help can go a long way...

horst horst
Well if you put it that way, I'm sure the rules can be bent a little.
It would be a shame to see such a gifted child not reach his full
potential.

Carol Brown
Thank you! Thank you so much! I'll never forget this.


You're glad to have helped someone and have a little something in
return for your good deed.

Jan 31: Wednesday afternoon


You see a student hard at work in the cooking club.

Jan 31: Wednesday evening


A young student shares her lunch break with a beastly cute cat.

Night


It's getting late, so you decide to go to sleep.
